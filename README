Scenario: You built a nice simple project. It was straightforward, it worked,
everyone agreed it was cute. Flash forward several time periods and your
project has become large, accompanied by an unwieldy Makefile with hacks so
obtuse that mothers advise their children not to look directly at it for fear
of being blinded.

The Makefile works, or at least you think it does, but how can you be sure?
Enter scrutineer. Scrutineer repeatedly executes your Makefile and explicitly
lists the dependency structure it finds. Comparing the output to your own
intuition of what the Makefile should be doing helps expose where the problems
in your Makefile are.
