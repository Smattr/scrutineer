Scenario: You built a nice simple project. It was straightforward, it worked,
everyone agreed it was cute. Flash forward several time periods and your
project has become large, accompanied by an unwieldy Makefile with hacks so
obtuse that mothers advise their children not to look directly at it for fear
of being blinded.

The Makefile works, or at least you think it does, but how can you be sure?
Enter scrutineer. Scrutineer repeatedly executes your Makefile and explicitly
lists the dependency structure it finds. Comparing the output to your own
intuition of what the Makefile should be doing helps expose where the problems
in your Makefile are.

If you find any bugs with this code or would like a feature implemented, please
email me at matthew.fernandez@gmail.com or create an issue on github. My current
to-do list is:
 - Options for specifying the working directory during build.

A note to hackers: while exploring/using this project you may find yourself
wondering, if there is a tool to validate your existing Makefile, is it
possible to create a tool that builds your Makefile from scratch without the
error prone process of writing it yourself? Such a thing is indeed possible,
but is left as an exercise to the reader...
